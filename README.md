# nform
nform is a number-to-word converter and to other forms based on a simple set of rules. To use, just simply copy the nform.py file to your other python file location. Then put

    import nform

to import it. Finally, put

    nform.word_form(number)

and it will return a string with the number in word form. Any help and issues are appreciated.

# NOTE: ONLY SUPPORTS NUMBERS FROM 0-999. ANY OTHER NUMBERS MAY RETURN A UNWANTED VALUE OR PRODUCE AN ERROR.
